# RPJ (roc-project)

A simple project management tool because I have a ton of folders of code and need a way to open them fast.
This is the rust port of my [RProj tool](https://github.com/JadenLabs/rproj) made in Python.

**CURRENTLY IN AN ALPHA STATE - MISSING FEATURES**

---

## Features

-   Keep track of your projects
-   Open projects quickly in VSC or file explorer - just type the name
-   Open a terminal for your project fast (todo)
-   Run code for your projects easily

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

-   Rust
-   Cargo

#### With cargo

1. Install with cargo
    ```bash

#### With cli (not recommended)

Auto-PATHing only works on Windows at the moment

1. Clone the project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jadenlabs/rpj

    cargo run -- install
    ```

#### Guidelines:

-   Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit style.
-   Do not push code that you do not have the rights to.
-   Do not push code that has primarily been generated by a llm, using it to debug is fine.
-   Make sure to satisfy clippy before pushing a PR (run `cargo clippy --verbose -- -D warnings`)
